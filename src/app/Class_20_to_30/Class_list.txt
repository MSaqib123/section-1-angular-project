20. Introducing Signals
    Zone.js (Old Jugaar):
        Zone.js watches all async events (like clicks) and makes Angular check every component, slowing down big apps.
        It’s like a nosy chacha checking every chai stall table when only one order changes.
    Signals (Smart Jugaar):
        Signals track specific state (like selectUser) and update only the UI parts that need it.
        They’re fast, clear, and enable efficient, zoneless Angular apps.
