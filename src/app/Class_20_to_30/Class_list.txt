20. Introducing Signals
    Zone.js (Old Jugaar):
        Zone.js watches all async events (like clicks) and makes Angular check every component, slowing down big apps.
        It’s like a nosy chacha checking every chai stall table when only one order changes.
    Signals (Smart Jugaar):
        Signals track specific state (like selectUser) and update only the UI parts that need it.
        They’re fast, clear, and enable efficient, zoneless Angular apps.


21. We Need More Flexible Components!
    // the above all technic of displayin data in component is totaly wrong 
    // we need more flexible things


22. Defining Component Inputs
    // passing INput to component
    // getting  data from  parent to Child  component


23. Required & Optional Inputs
    // we set  required = true  to    force user to pass data to child component


24. Using Signal Inputs
    //single  input  are  set only an static  can not be change during component
    ///but  singles are  very integent as in beiging we test


25. We Need Custom Events!
    // we need Custom Event   we  can  do it by
    

26. Working with Outputs & Emitting Data
    // Output();    decorator
    // we need custom event so we cuse    Output decorator to   emit values in app componet


27. Using the output() Function
        // output is singl method  which is  much easy and good 


28. Adding Extra Type Information To EventEmitter
    // adding    datatype to EventEmitter


29. Exercise Create a Configurable Component
    //adding  tasks   component to handle  task of users
    // show the name on each click on user in  task component
    // passing the  userValue to  Task
